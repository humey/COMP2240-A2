Q1 - Single lane bridge threading problem with 2 types of farming North/South. Only 1 farmer is allowed on the bridge at any one time.

Q2 - Covid safe shop with multithreading - Input file of customers, only 5 customers are allowed in the shop at once. If all 5 spots get taken 
the shop will add "5 Minutes" of cleaning time before letting more customers in that have been waiting

Q3 - Same as Q2 but using a monitor and synchronized method blocks instead of Java Semaphores
